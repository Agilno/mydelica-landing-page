                                <p>
                                    On 14 th April, the prestigious medical journal, The New England Journal of Medicine,
                                    published a landmark report on a clinical trial comparing psilocybin therapy with the
                                    selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant, escitalopram, in the treatment
                                    of fifty-nine people with moderate to severe depression. The trial was conducted by the
                                    Centre for Psychedelic Research, Imperial College London. This head-to-head with a current
                                    first line treatment for depression - and one of the best performing antidepressants - is the
                                    most rigorous test of a psychedelic medicine to-date.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A bit of context: depression is the leading contributor to the global burden of disease and
                                    number one for life years lost to disability, well ahead of cancer for example. Much of this
                                    disability relates to absenteeism and presenteeism – which means working when depressed
                                    and impaired. Reports of depression and anxiety have increased during the Covid-19
                                    pandemic 1 . Most people who take their own life, will have suffered a mood disorder like
                                    depression, and suicide is the most common cause of death for young men.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are first-line treatments for
                                    depression. In 2018, the percentage of the UK adult population prescribed an
                                    antidepressant was 17%, similar to the US 3 , but annual antidepressant prescription rates
                                    regularly increase 2 . The antidepressant market is estimated to be worth around $15B 4 .
                                    Response rates to SSRI antidepressants tend to average around 50% and meta-analyses
                                    indicate they are barely more effective than placebo 5 . Common complaints about SSRIs
                                    include that they blunt one’s emotional range, cause sexual dysfunction, drowsiness and
                                    other side effects, take weeks to work, and are difficult to come off.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Optimism about the therapeutic potential of psychedelic compounds began to build in the
                                    2010s and is still trending upwards. At least five phase 2 clinical trials have shown promising
                                    results of psilocybin on depressive symptoms. The most recent trial reported 71% response
                                    rates 4 weeks post treatment, markedly higher than what we have become accustomed to
                                    with SSRIs of psychotherapy. Using the same measure (the so-called ‘HAM-D’), response
                                    rates to psilocybin in our recent trial were 75%, versus a mere 24% in the escitalopram
                                    group. On another measure which required patients to rate their own depression, response
                                    rates to psilocybin therapy were 70% versus 48% in the escitalopram group.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are a couple of things I’d like to share about this trial and particularly the experience
                                    of having it published in such a prestigious journal. They relate to the manner in which the
                                    results are described in the paper, and the intention is to give the reader some insight about
                                    why they have been framed as they have. I anticipate many reading the paper will be struck
                                    by comments like “no clinical conclusions can be drawn about these data” and “[the trial]
                                    did not show a significant difference in antidepressant effects” and think “hold, on, how
                                    does this compute with the much higher response and remission rates, breadth of
                                    improvements and even the positive side effect profile of psilocybin versus escitalopram? To
                                    which my reply is: “yes, quite!”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So, let me explain: the original manuscript submitted to NEJM gave a very different
                                    description of the results than how they appear in the paper, so how did this happen? The
                                    original paper passed relatively easily through review but was then taken on by a journal
                                    editor and large sections were re-written. What the reader is presented therefore are not
                                    the words of the paper’s authors but are instead a product of the editorial process. I have
                                    never experienced an editorial process quite like it to be honest. Typically, the majority of
                                    the back and forth is with reviewers. I’ve never known an editor to take such a hands-on
                                    approach to the actual writing of the text. It was a difficult process to be part of, because, of
                                    course, you want your paper to be accepted by arguably the most prestigious science and
                                    medical journal around, and so the power in this relationship is definitely not with the
                                    submitting authors!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On top of the understandable desire to see those satisfying words “we are pleased to accept
                                    your manuscript for publication in The New England Journal of Medicine’, was the consoling
                                    thought that “at least they can’t change the actual results!” and “readers will be able to look
                                    at the values themselves and determine ‘the truth’ for themselves.” One slight issue here,
                                    however, is that many readers only proceed as far as the abstract and they need to go
                                    further to properly process this study’s findings. The discrepancy between the actual trial
                                    results and the framing of them is one of the reasons why I have been so keen to comment
                                    on the paper in the media and via outlets like this blog. So, let me say it again, please do
                                    look at the values themselves, the response and remission rates, secondary outcomes, and
                                    the side effect profiles. Much of these data can be found in tables and figures relegated to a
                                    supplementary appendix that accompanies the paper. We had originally included two of
                                    these figures in the main paper, the forest plots shown here. All horizontal bars shown in
                                    green reflect a &gt;95% confidence level that there is a true difference between the groups.
                                    QIDS, HAM-D, MADRS and BDI are measures of depression and STAI measures trait anxiety.
                                    These data are for baseline versus week-6.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Bias is a major issue in medical science. The reporting of clinical trial data pertaining to the
                                    safety and efficacy of SSRIs has received much scrutiny, and it is right that it has. It is also
                                    right that clinical research with psychedelics be scrutinised by the same high standards.
                                    Psychedelic research is at particular risk of psychological biases, such as confirmation 6 and

                                    expectancy biases 7 . Researchers in our group recently demonstrated that the positive
                                    effects associated with ‘microdosing’, i.e., the taking of very low doses of psychedelics, are
                                    driven mostly by positive expectancy 8 . Could the same be true of higher dose psychedelic
                                    therapy? And if ‘yes’, would this render psychedelics little more than positive-expectancy
                                    enhancers? If it does indeed transpire that positive expectancy is a substantial component
                                    of psychedelics’ therapeutic action, would this be a problem? Is expectancy not always at
                                    play when one receives a medical treatment? What if we view it as a potentially exploitable
                                    ally rather than a scientifically confounding foe?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    How do I feel about the conservative framing of our trial results? I would be lying if I said I
                                    was entirely comfortable with it. As a scientist, I am passionately committed to scientific
                                    rigour, which includes being mindful, and properly declaring of, all potential areas of bias. In
                                    medical science we refer to the balanced treatment of different trial conditions as clinical
                                    equipoise, which means that you approach the trial with uncertainty about the relative
                                    merits and limitations of each treatment or intervention being assessed 9 .
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In framing the trial results as showing no difference between the two conditions, we are
                                    being faithful to the principle that you should judge trial results first and foremost by the
                                    results of the main, pre-selected contrast. Also, in saying no conclusions can be drawn on
                                    the secondary outcomes due to the absence of correction for multiple testing, we are being
                                    faithful to good statistical practice. However, when one factors in how consistently the
                                    secondary outcomes favoured psilocybin and by what margin, it is easy to suspect the miss
                                    on the primary outcome as a false negative. Added to this is the fact that we predicted
                                    psilocybin’s superiority on well-being ahead of the trial and yet were not allowed to report
                                    the relevant contrast as statistically significant because we had not stated, pre-trial that the
                                    relevant measure was a main outcome. In actual fact, although we selected the QIDS as our
                                    main outcome, we had not predicted psilocybin’s superiority on this measure. Psilocybin
                                    actually outperformed our pre-trial expectations!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Returning to the matter of bias, set in a context of much enthusiasm and inflated
                                    expectations about the therapeutic potential of psilocybin, I would rather be challenged for
                                    being too conservative in our interpretation of our trial’s findings, than too promotional.
                                    Perhaps it is best we view the journal’s conversative marshalling of the write up of the
                                    results as not inconsistent with statistical good practice. Moreover, we might also view it as
                                    a healthy counterweight to what would otherwise have been too scandalous a finding:
